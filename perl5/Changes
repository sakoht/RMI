Revision history for RMI:

0.11 ?????? ????????
        Large API cleanup.
        Added a copy_results flag to allow serialization of results.
        Added a copy_params flag to replace the old copy flag.
        When params or results are copied this is done with an independent call instead of using a special encoding value.
        Added a serialization_protocol property to break out that part of the system.
        Fixed and renamed _is_proxy and _has_proxy.

        Any package/class can have custom proxy handling by implementing RMI::Proxy::$CLASSNAME
        Custom handling for DBI gets around odd XS issues.
        Build process cleanup.
