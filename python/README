RMI - Remote Method Invocation with transparent proxies

STATUS
    This is a half-implemented copy of the Perl RMI module.  It barely passes its one test case script.
    It has some distance to go before it implements the basic features of object sharing between Python processes.
    After that Python<->Perl integration must be done in both source trees.

INSTALLATION
    python setup.py build
    sudo python setup.py install
