=head1 NAME

RMI::ProxyReference - used internally by RMI::Node to tie references
    
=head1 DESCRIPTION

When an refrerence is detected in the params or return value for an RMI
call, the sending RMI::Node (client sending params or server sending
results) captures a reference to the item internally, generates an "id"
for that object, and sends the "id" across the handle instead.

When the remote side recieves the "id", it also recieves an indication
that this is the id of a proxied reference, an indication of what Perl
base type it is (SCALAR,ARRAY,HASH,CODE,GLOB/IO), and what class it is
blessed-into, if any.  The remote side constructs a reference of
the appropriate type, and uses "tie" to bind it to this package.

All subsequent attempst to use the reference fire AUTOLOAD,
and result in a request across the "wire" to the other side.

Note: if the reference is blessed, it also blesses the object as an
B<RMI::ProxyObject>.  Because bless and tie are independent, a
single reference can be blessed and tied to two independent
classes, one for method call resolution, and one for usage of
the reference as a HASH ref, ARRAY ref, CODE ref, etc.

Details of Perl tie are somewhat esoteric, but it is worth mentioning
that tying a reference $o results in an additional, separate object
being created, which is the invocant above whenever activity on the
reference occurs.  That second object is managed internally by Perl,
though we are able to use it to store the identify of $o on the "real" side,
along with information about the RMI::Node through which to proxy
calls.

Note: CODE references are not tied, and do not use this class.  A
proxy for a code reference is generated as an anonymous subrotine
which makes a remote call via its RMI::Node upon execute.

=head1 METHODS

The RMI::ProxyReference implements TIEHASH TIEARRAY TIESCALAR and
TIEHANDLE with a single implementation.  All other methods are
implemented by proxying back to the original side via AUTOLOAD.

On the local side, attempts to access the real reference go through
Tie::StdArray, Tie::StdHash, Tie::StdScalar and Tie::StdHandle.  Note
that we do not _actually_ "tie" the real reference on the original side
before sending it.  These methods work just fine with the
